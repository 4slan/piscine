# piscine

I start with the basics, and using a computer, I'll write my first lines of code before moving on to more complex coding exercises.
Throughout this Piscine, I have tried and I have failed, over and over again. Thatâ€™s was the point: learning the trial-and-error process builds stamina, determination, and process skills that are necessary to be a software engineer.

No teachers, no classes or courses, no books. I have worked by yourself and in groups, asked my peers for help, helped my peers, and completed projects.
